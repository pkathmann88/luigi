# Module Design Skill - Quick Reference

This is a quick reference guide for using the Luigi Module Design Skill effectively.

## What is the Module Design Skill?

The module-design skill provides comprehensive guidance for **designing Luigi modules BEFORE implementation**. It ensures hardware safety, proper architecture, and maintainability through a **two-stage workflow**:

1. **Stage 1:** Design Analysis (3 analysis phases)
2. **Stage 2:** Implementation Plan (5 implementation phases)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you receive a feature request:

✅ **Use module-design skill when:**
- Receiving a feature request for a new module
- Analyzing hardware requirements
- Designing software architecture
- Planning service integration
- Creating implementation plans

❌ **Don't use this skill for:**
- Writing Python code (use `python-development` skill)
- Implementing hardware connections (use `raspi-zero-w` skill)
- Writing deployment scripts (use `system-setup` skill)
- These are implementation tasks in Stage 2

### Two-Stage Workflow Details

**STAGE 1: Design Analysis (DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md)**
- **When:** Upon receiving feature request
- **Purpose:** Analyze and design before implementation
- **Output:** Approved design document
- **Phases:** 3 analysis phases
  1. Requirements & Hardware Analysis
  2. Software Architecture Analysis
  3. Service & Deployment Analysis

**STAGE 2: Implementation (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)**
- **When:** After DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md is approved
- **Purpose:** Execute the implementation
- **Input:** Results from DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md
- **Phases:** 5 implementation phases (TDD approach)
  1. Testing Strategy Implementation (write tests first)
  2. Core Implementation (implement to pass tests)
  3. Documentation Implementation
  4. Setup & Deployment Implementation
  5. Final Verification & Integration

### Why Two Stages?

**Benefits:**
- **Safety**: Hardware design verified before building
- **Quality**: Software architecture validated before coding
- **Efficiency**: Avoid rework by catching issues in analysis
- **Traceability**: Implementation directly references design decisions

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Safety First
- Verify all voltage levels (3.3V GPIO safe)
- Check current requirements
- Validate polarity before power-on
- Use protection components (resistors, diodes)

### 2. Follow Luigi Patterns
- Module structure: `category/module-name/`
- Configuration: `/etc/luigi/{category}/{module-name}/`
- Service: systemd with auto-restart
- Setup: `setup.sh` with install/uninstall/status

### 3. Design for Safety
- No 5V directly to GPIO inputs
- Current limiting resistors for LEDs
- Diode protection for inductive loads
- Clear wiring diagrams with pin numbers

### 4. Design for Security
- No shell injection (use subprocess with list)
- Path traversal prevention
- Log sanitization
- Subprocess timeouts

### 5. Design for Testing
- Mock GPIO support
- Syntax validation without hardware
- Clear test strategy (unit, integration, hardware)

## Common Design Tasks

### Selecting GPIO Pins

**Priority:**
1. General purpose pins (GPIO23, GPIO24, GPIO25) - Use these first
2. PWM pins (GPIO18, GPIO12, GPIO13) - If you need PWM
3. Special pins (I2C, SPI, UART) - Only if you need these interfaces

**Document both:**
- BCM number (e.g., GPIO23)
- Physical pin number (e.g., Pin 16)

### Creating Wiring Diagrams

**Include:**
- Component pin names
- Raspberry Pi pins (BCM and physical)
- Connection arrows
- Inline components (resistors, diodes)
- Power connections (VCC, GND)
- Safety notes

**Format:**
```
Component        Raspberry Pi Zero W
---------        -------------------
VCC      ------> 5V (Pin 2 or 4)
GND      ------> Ground (Pin 6)
Data     ------> GPIO23 (Pin 16)
```

### Designing Configuration

**Location:** `/etc/luigi/{category}/{module-name}/{module-name}.conf`

**Format:** INI-style with sections
```ini
[Hardware]
INPUT_PIN=23

[Timing]
COOLDOWN=1800

[Files]
LOG_FILE=/var/log/module.log

[Logging]
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Planning Testing

**Three levels:**
1. **Syntax:** `python3 -m py_compile module.py`
2. **Logic:** Mock GPIO tests without hardware
3. **Integration:** Hardware tests on actual Raspberry Pi

## Example: Designing a Temperature Monitor

### 1. Requirements
- Read temperature from DHT22 sensor
- Log readings every 5 minutes
- Alert if temperature exceeds threshold
- Web dashboard to view data

### 2. Hardware Design
- Component: DHT22 sensor (3.3V compatible)
- GPIO: GPIO4 (Pin 7) - supports DHT22 protocol
- Wiring: VCC to 3.3V, GND to GND, Data to GPIO4
- Power: Within Raspberry Pi capacity

### 3. Software Design
- Config class: Load settings
- GPIOManager: Initialize GPIO
- DHT22Sensor: Read temperature/humidity
- TempMonitorApp: Main logic with threshold checks
- Configuration: Poll interval, thresholds, alerting

### 4. Safety Checks
- DHT22 is 3.3V compatible ✅
- Current draw ~2.5mA (well within limits) ✅
- No special protection needed ✅
- Wiring diagram created ✅

### 5. Ready for Implementation
- Design documented in template ✅
- Hardware checklist complete ✅
- Design review complete ✅
- Approved → Start implementation

## Integration with Other Skills

The four Luigi skills work together:

```
module-design (DESIGN PHASE)
    ↓
    Use raspi-zero-w for hardware details
    Use python-development for code patterns
    ↓
python-development (IMPLEMENTATION PHASE)
    ↓
system-setup (DEPLOYMENT PHASE)
```

**Design Phase (module-design):**
- What to build
- How to connect hardware safely
- Software architecture plan
- Configuration structure

**Implementation Phase (python-development, raspi-zero-w):**
- Write Python code
- Connect hardware
- Test components
- Implement planned design

**Deployment Phase (system-setup):**
- Create setup script
- Package for distribution
- Deploy to Raspberry Pi
- Verify installation

## Tips for Effective Design

### DO:
✅ Complete design before writing code  
✅ Document all hardware connections  
✅ Verify safety with checklists  
✅ Get peer review before implementation  
✅ Use the design template systematically  
✅ Reference the SKILL.md for patterns  
✅ Plan for testing without hardware  

### DON'T:
❌ Skip safety verification  
❌ Start coding before design is complete  
❌ Forget to document GPIO pins  
❌ Ignore power calculations  
❌ Skip the design review checklist  
❌ Connect hardware without wiring diagram  
❌ Forget Mock GPIO support
