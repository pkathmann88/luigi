# Luigi Management Frontend - Static Credentials Example
# Format: username:password (one per line)
# 
# SECURITY WARNINGS:
# 1. This is a SIMPLE authentication system for local network use only
# 2. Copy this file to 'credentials.txt' and set your own password
# 3. Never commit actual credentials to version control
# 4. In production, consider using:
#    - Environment variables
#    - External authentication systems
#    - OAuth/OIDC providers
# 5. Credentials are stored in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS)
# 6. Always use HTTPS when deploying
# 
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file: cp credentials.txt.example credentials.txt
# 2. Edit credentials.txt with your password
# 3. Ensure file permissions are restrictive: chmod 600 credentials.txt
# 4. Rebuild the frontend to update hardcoded credentials
