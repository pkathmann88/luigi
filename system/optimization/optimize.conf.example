# System Optimization Configuration
# This file configures which optimizations are applied to the Raspberry Pi Zero W

[Services]
# Services to disable (comma-separated)
# Common services safe to disable on headless systems:
# - bluetooth, hciuart: Bluetooth services
# - ModemManager: Modem management (not needed for most setups)
# - avahi-daemon: mDNS/Bonjour (only needed for .local domain names)
# - triggerhappy: Hotkey daemon
# - console-setup: Console font/keymap setup
# - alsa-restore: Audio state restoration (if not using audio)
# - rpc-statd-notify: NFS client service (if not using NFS)
# - rpi-eeprom-update: EEPROM update service (can be run manually)
disable_services=bluetooth,hciuart,ModemManager,triggerhappy,console-setup

# Services to mask (prevent from being started)
# These are automatic update/maintenance timers that can consume resources
mask_services=apt-daily-upgrade.timer,apt-daily.timer

[Boot]
# Boot configuration optimizations to apply to /boot/firmware/config.txt
# Set to yes/no for each option

# Disable unused hardware interfaces to save memory and CPU
disable_i2c=no
disable_i2s=yes
disable_spi=no
disable_audio=no
disable_camera=yes
disable_wifi=no
disable_bluetooth=no

# GPU memory in MB (16 is minimum for headless, default is 64)
# Lower values free up more RAM for the system
gpu_mem=16

[Kernel]
# Kernel module blacklisting
# Modules to blacklist (comma-separated, commented out by default)
# Example modules:
# - snd_bcm2835: Built-in audio
# - bcmbt: Bluetooth
# - brcmfmac, brcmutil: WiFi
# - uvc, videobuf2: Camera/video
blacklist_modules=

[Packages]
# Packages to remove (comma-separated)
# Be careful with this - only remove packages you're certain are not needed
# Examples: bluez, avahi-daemon, modemmanager
remove_packages=

[Logging]
# Log file for optimization script
log_file=/var/log/luigi/system-optimization.log
